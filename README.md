Retail Price Optimization
Overview
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts the optimal retail price for products based on various factors such as product details, order details, review scores, competitor prices, customer demographics, and more. By analyzing this data, we aim to optimize retail prices, leading to maximized sales and improved customer satisfaction.

Problem Statement
In the competitive retail industry, setting the right price is crucial. Dynamic pricing models powered by machine learning can help predict optimal pricing strategies, increase sales, and ensure customers are satisfied. Our model will consider a variety of factors, including product characteristics, order details, customer reviews, competitor prices, and other time-based features.

Features in the Dataset
The dataset includes the following key features:

Product Details: Product ID, category, weight, dimensions, etc.
Order Details: Approved date, delivery date, estimated delivery date, etc.
Review Details: Customer review score, review comments, etc.
Pricing and Competition Details: Total price, freight price, unit price, competitor prices, etc.
Time Details: Month, year, weekday, weekend, holiday.
Customer Details: ZIP code, order item ID, etc.
Objective
The objective of this project is to predict the optimal price for a product using machine learning models. By doing so, we aim to help businesses make informed pricing decisions that maximize both sales and customer satisfaction.

Project Steps
1. Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values.
Convert categorical features to numerical format using encoding methods.
Scale numerical features to prepare for model training.
Create new features (feature engineering) that may enhance model performance.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize the data to understand relationships between features.
Analyze distributions, correlations, and outliers.
Investigate the impact of various features on pricing.
3. Model Selection
We will evaluate and train multiple machine learning algorithms, such as:

Linear Regression
Decision Trees / Random Forests
Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
XGBoost
Neural Networks (if applicable)
4. Model Evaluation
Use cross-validation to assess model performance.
Tune hyperparameters to improve accuracy.
Evaluate model performance based on key metrics (e.g., Mean Absolute Error, R-squared).
5. Deployment (Optional)
If successful, the model can be deployed for real-time price optimization in production environments.

Installation

Example Workflow
Data Loading: Load the dataset from a CSV file or database.
Preprocessing: Clean the data, handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
Modeling: Train a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest) to predict the optimal price.
Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
Optimization: Use the trained model to predict optimal prices for unseen products and orders.
